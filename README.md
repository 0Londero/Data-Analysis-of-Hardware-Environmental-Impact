# üåç Data Analysis of Hardware Environmental Impact

## Overview

This project investigates the environmental impact of hardware devices by analyzing their lifecycle emissions. Using statistical techniques, we identify key factors‚Äîsuch as weight, screen size, and manufacturer‚Äîthat contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in different lifecycle stages: manufacturing, transport, use, and disposal.

Designed with stakeholders like municipalities, manufacturers, and investors in mind, the analysis supports data-driven decisions for sustainability, urban logistics, and e-waste policy.

---

## Objectives

- Quantify the influence of physical and categorical device characteristics on emissions.
- Highlight emission disparities between manufacturers and usage categories.
- Support sustainable manufacturing, logistics, and recycling policy improvements.
